/**
 * 659. 分割数组为连续子序列
 * <p>
 * 给你一个按升序排序的整数数组 num（可能包含重复数字），请你将它们分割成一个或多个子序列，其中每个子序列都由连续整数组成且长度至少为 3 。
 * <p>
 * 如果可以完成上述分割，则返回 true ；否则，返回 false 。
 * <p>
 * 示例 1：
 * <p>
 * 输入: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
 * 输出: True
 * 解释:
 * 你可以分割出这样两个连续子序列 :
 * 1, 2, 3
 * 3, 4, 5
 * <p>
 * 示例 2：
 * <p>
 * 输入: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
 * 输出: True
 * 解释:
 * 你可以分割出这样两个连续子序列 :
 * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 * 3, 4, 5
 * <p>
 * 示例 3：
 * <p>
 * 输入: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
